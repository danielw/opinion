RoutingNavigator
================

This plugin installs a handy routing navigator at the bottom of each page, showing all available routes and named routes.
The navigator is only available in development mode.  You can turn it on or off in a controller by using the given method:

  class FooController < ApplicationController
    routing_navigator :off # turns the routing navigator off completely
    routing_navigator :only   => [:show, :edit]
    routing_navigator :except => [:create, :update, :destroy]
  end

This plugin currently requires Edge Rails because it uses the new and improved Routing system.

INSTALLATION

The routing_navigator js and css files should be copied to public upon plugin installation.  If not, run the available rake task to update.

  rake update_routing_navigator

You must include these on your pages for the styling to look correctly.  You may need to tweak them to work with your site layout, however.

    <%= javascript_include_tag 'routing_navigator' %>
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'routing_navigator' %>

Make sure you have a route that will work with the routing_navigator controller.  The standard :controller/:action/:id one will work great.
