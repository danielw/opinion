    A gravatar, or <strong>g</strong>lobally <strong>r</strong>ecognized <strong>avatar</strong>, is quite simply an 80Ã—80 pixel avatar image that follows you from weblog to weblog appearing beside your name when you comment on gravatar enabled sites. Avatars help identify your posts on web forums, so why not on weblogs? (quoted from <a href="http://www.gravatar.com">www.gravatar.com</a>)
